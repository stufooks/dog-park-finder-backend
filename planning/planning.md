## Concept: 
An app for finding and reviewing dog parks. Allow users to provide feedback regarding amenities at the parks including:
- Overall size
- Bathrooms
- Parking
- Misc

## CRUD functionality:
- Create: user can uplaod info about a new dog park
- Read: have a homepage that lists all dog parks, and a show page that shows more info on one dog park
- Update: allow users to upvote and downvote parks, as well as information about parks. Each vote will update the DB entry for that park
- Delete: allow users to delete parks (as MVP without authentication)

## Stretch goals:
- Implement Google maps to show dog parks on the map and allow users to search for parks within a certain radius/area
- Implement User Authentication for uploading and deleting dog parks
